# Flask-tutorial
A tutorial to create a microblog.
Built with flask, html, css.

## Project status

This project is currently in development.


- Users can register with the blog, upload a post, upload a profile picture, change their login details.
- Other functionality in progress.


## Reflection
Project goals: familiarizing myself with flask documentation and understanding the process of a software engineering project.

This is one of my first few software engieering projects, so it was quite different from other data science projects, where most of the code are done in in jupyter notebooks or google colab.

I have to understand the justification for the project layout and how each module interacts with each other.
I have to learn how to set up virtual environment for this specific project, and version control via git and github.

I was exposed to a few extensions/libraries that were compatible with flask and I learnt a lot from their documentation and implemention from examples.

Various extensions were used in this project:
- flask_sqlachemy
- flask_login
- flask_wtf, wtforms
- flask_mail

Main conceptual takeaways:
- Project layout
- Virtual environment
- Version control
